# logic-teaching
PCB for teaching logic principles to primary and secondary school children.

Board has spaces for a dual AA battery holder for power, 4 LEDs, 4 pushbuttons and pullup/down resistors, 4 SPDT switches, and 2 DIP-14 sockets.

Most connections apart from power to ICs and protection resistors will be made by students via the connectors available. Any user connections to power rails will go through a soldered-on protection resistor to limit short circuit current.

LEDs and pushbuttons will have easy-to-use connections (bananna plugs, wire loop test points) as well as standard 0.1" headers used by other components.
